# ðŸ§ª Lab: Introduction to AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)

## Overview

This lab provides hands-on experience with managing access and permissions to AWS services using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). You will explore IAM users and groups, inspect IAM policies, follow a real-world scenario to add users to groups with specific capabilities, and experiment with the effects of policies on service access.

## Level

Fundamental

## Prerequisites

- Update the `terraform.tfvars` file with your AWS access key ID and secret access key.
- Run `terraform init` to initialize the terraform
- Run `terraform apply` to setup the resources in aws.

## Lab Objectives

By completing this lab, you will:

- Explore pre-created IAM Users and Groups.
- Inspect IAM policies as applied to the pre-created groups.
- Follow a real-world scenario, adding users to groups with specific capabilities enabled.
- Locate and use the IAM sign-in URL.
- Experiment with the effects of policies on service access.

## Lab Structure

### 1. Introduction to IAM Users and Groups

- **Objective**: Explore pre-created IAM Users and Groups.

  - Understand the permissions granted by these policies.

### 3. Real-World Scenario: Adding Users to Groups

- **Objective**: Follow a real-world scenario, adding users to groups with specific capabilities enabled.
- **Steps**:
  - Create a new IAM user.
  - Add the user to a specific IAM group.
  - Assign policies to the group to grant specific permissions.

### 4. IAM Sign-in URL 

- **Objective**: Locate and use the IAM sign-in URL to login from newley created user.
- **Steps**:
  - Find the IAM sign-in URL in the AWS Management Console.

  - Log in using IAM-created user credentials.

### 5. Experimenting with Policy Effects

- **Objective**: Experiment with the effects of policies on service access.
- **Steps**:
  - Modify IAM policies to observe changes in service access.
  - Understand how IAM policies control permissions.


> **_NOTE:_** After completing the lab, you should destroy the resources so that it does not generate any bills. Run the following cmd after completing the lab.

```bash
terraform destroy
```
Confirm the destruction when prompted.
